# Sickle-Cell-Anemia-Detection
AI model for sickle cell anemia diagnosis using combined numerical &amp; image data. Transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 (images) &amp; SVM (numerical) achieved best accuracy. LIME &amp; Grad-CAM used for explainability, enabling faster, accurate, and accessible detection in low-resource settings.
